## Materials

## Instructions

Start working from the bottom of the feet, up to the top of the head.

### Legs

Make two in bright green.

> 1: 4 sc in magic ring (4)
>
> 2: inc x4 (8)
>
> 3: In blo, sc around (8)
>
> 4: sc around (8)
>

### Tail

Here, you'll switch between bright green and pale green to make a pale underbelly.

1: In bright, 4 sc in magic ring (4)

2: sc around (4)

3: In pale, 1 sc. In bright, 3 sc. (4)

4: In pale, inc. In bright, 1 sc, inc, 1 sc. (6)

5: in pale, 2 sc. In bright, inc, 2 sc, inc. (8)

6: In pale, 2 sc. In bright, 6 sc. (8)

7: In pale, inc, sc. In bright, 2 sc, inc, 3 sc. (10)

8--10: In pale, 3 sc. In bright, 7 sc. (10)

11: In pale, inc, 2 sc. In bright, inc, 2 sc, inc, 2 sc. (12)

Stuff!

Don't tie off.

### Joining legs & tail together to form the hips

Continuing from the tail. This transition is quite tricky.

1: In bright green, slst to the left leg. Turn. In pale, 6 sc. In bright, slst to the other leg. Turn. In pale, 6 sc.

Make sure the feet end up facing down, toward the pale green!

First, we'll create a clean starting point for future rounds. In bright green, 7 sc around the leg, and slst to the tail.

2--3: Turn. In bright, 7 sc around the leg. In pale, 6 sc. In bright, 7 sc around the leg, and slst to the tail.

You should now be back at your starting point again.

4: Turn. In bright, 7 sc around the leg. In pale, 6 sc. In bright, 7 sc around then leg, then 4 sc along the top of the tail.
1 sc for round numbers. (24)

Consider putting small weights like coins or hex nuts into the bottom of the feet to weigh them down.

Stuff the legs and tail.

It should now feel like a single round again instead of three parts!

### Body

You'll continue to switch between bright green and pale green to make a pale underbelly as you work up the torso.

5--8: In bright, 6 sc. In pale, 6 sc. In bright, 12 sc. (24)

9: In bright, 2 sc, dec, 2 sc. In pale, 2 sc, dec, 2 sc. In bright, 2 sc, dec, 8 sc. (21)

10: In bright, dec, 3 sc. In pale, 1 sc, dec, 2 sc. In bright, 3 sc, dec, 6 sc. (18)

11: In bright, dec, 2 sc. In pale, 1 sc, dec, 1 sc. In bright, 2 sc, dec, 2 sc, dec. (12)
